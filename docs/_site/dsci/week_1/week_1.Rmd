# What this course is about

--

- This course mainly aims to provide you complementary skills to standard  econometrics course.


--

- This involves the data cleaning, wrangling, data visualization, and data analysis (regression, machine learning etc).


---
# What is data?

--

- Data is a collection of facts, such as numbers, words, measurements, observations or just descriptions of things.

--

- Data can be qualitative (text, maps, photographs, social media (X, Instagram, Spotify)..) or quantitative (economic variables (prices, wages, trade, output, consumption etc.)).

--

- Qualitative data can be analyzed in multiple ways. One common method is data coding, which refers to the process of transforming the raw collected data into a set of meaningful categories that describe essential concepts of the data.

--

- Quantitative data can be measured in different ways: e-commerce data (IKEA, hepsiburada..). This challenges the traditional metrics such as CPI, GDP because they are not able to capture the economic activities adequately.

# Why is the data science relevant in recent years?

--
- The amount of data generated by humans is increasing exponentially. This is due to the digitalization of the economy and the society.


--
- The data can be used to predict the future events, to understand the past events, and to make better decisions.


---
# What is data science?

--
- Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data.

# What is R?

--
- R is a programming language and free software environment for statistical computing and graphics supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing.


--
- Not just a statistical package but a programming language that can be used for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis and reporting.

--
- Open source and free to use. This leads to a large community of users and developers. You can find and use most updated statistical methods and packages.

--
- You can also join the discussion groups and ask questions about your problems, contributing to the vibrant community.


---
# Why R?

--
- R is a powerful tool for data analysis and visualization. It is widely used in academia, industry, and government.

--
- R talks to many data sources: Excel, SPSS, SAS, Stata, SQL, Google Sheets, and many more.

---
# What is RStudio?

--
- RStudio is an editor that makes it easier to write R code. It is a powerful tool that helps you to write, run, and debug R code.


--
- You may consider the RStudio as other editors i.e. Overleaf, Sublime Text, Atom, or Jupyter Notebook. Most of R users prefer RStudio because it is user-friendly and has many features that make your life easier.

# RStudio screen


--
- The left panel is the script editor where you write your code.


--
- The right panel is the console where you run your code.


--
- The bottom panel is the environment (one of the most advantageous part of the R) where you can see the objects you created and the history of your commands.


--
- The top panel is the menu where you can find the tools and options.


--
- You can also see the packages you installed and the help files of the functions you use.


--
- You can also see the plots you created.

# Simple exercise - revisiting Kaldor Law #1

--
- Kaldor states that the manufacturing industry is the engine of economic growth.


&Delta; log(y<sub>it</sub>) = &beta;<sub>0</sub> + &beta;<sub>1</sub>&Delta; log(x<sub>it</sub>) + u<sub>it</sub>



--
- To test this hypothesis, in previous statistic packages firstly we need to download the data from the internet (WDI, FRED, Eurostat, etc.)), 

--
- import it to the software, 

--
- Prepare the data file and make the appropriate transformations,


--
- and then run the regression.



---
# Simple exercise - revisiting Kaldor Law #1

--
- Seven lines of code in R can do all these steps.


```{r}
library(WDI) # Call World Development Indicators package
library(data.table) # Required packages to define the dataset as 
                    #a data.table (we will learn this later)

series <-  WDI_data$series # List of the series
countries <-  WDI_data$country # List of the countries

# Select the indicators, countries and time range

dat2 = WDI(indicator = c("NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG", # GDP growth
                         "NV.IND.MANF.KD.ZG"), # manufacturing growth
           country = c("all"), # All countries
           start = 1960, end = 2025) # Time range

reg1 <- lm(NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG ~ NV.IND.MANF.KD.ZG, 
           data = dat2) # Run the regression
summary(reg1) # Summarize the results

```

# Graph

```{r}
library(WDI)
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)
dat = setDT(WDI(indicator = "NY.GDP.PCAP.KD", country = c("TR", "KR", "US"), start = 1960, end = 2025))
ggplot(dat, aes(year, NY.GDP.PCAP.KD, color=country)) + geom_line() + 
  xlab("Year") + ylab("GDP per capita")
```
