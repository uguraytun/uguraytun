# Before starting

--

- In this week We learn the basics of R. 


--

- Before starting, I should recommend to use copilot. It is a great tool to learn R. It completes your code and gives you hints about the functions and packages. You can find information in the syllabus.


--

- Second thing, creating a R project for this course makes your life easier. Do not forget to specify directory for your project.


--

- Firstly open a folder titled "ECON413". Then create a project for this directory. File -> New Project -> Existing Directory -> Browse -> Select the directory -> Create Project


--
- Organize the folders in your project. Create folders such as "R files", "Data", "Raw data", "Results". When beginning  to new project, I always create these folders.

# Basics -arithmetic operations

-- R is great calculator. You can use it for basic arithmetic operations.

```{r}
# 1. Addition
2+3

# 2. Subtraction
5-3

# 3. Division
10/2

# 4. Multiplication
3*4



```



---
# Basics -arithmetic operations (cont.)

-- R is great calculator. You can use it for basic arithmetic operations.

```{r}
# 5. Exponentiation
2^3

# 6. Order of operations
(2+3)*4

# 7. Modulo
100 %/% 60 ## How many whole hours in 100 minutes?

```


---
# Basics -logical operations

-- R is great for logical operations.

```{r}
# 1. Greater than
2>3

# 
1 > 2 & 1 > 0.5 ## The "&" stands for "and"

# 
1 > 2 | 1 > 0.5 ## The "|" stands for "or"

```







---
# Basics -logical operations (cont.)

-- R is great for logical operations.

```{r}
# 2. Negation (!) -this helps us to filter the data.

!(2>3)


# 3. Value matching (==)
"apple" == "orange"

# %in% is a great operator to check if a value is in a vector.
4 %in% c(1,2,3,4,5)

# "Not-in" operator
`%ni%` = Negate(`%in%`)
4 %ni% 5:10

```




---
# Basics -logical operations (cont.)

-- R is great for logical operations.

```{r}
# 4. Floating-point numbers

0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3

# all.equal() is a great function to compare floating-point numbers.

all.equal(0.1 + 0.2, 0.3)


```




---
# Basics -assignment

-- Use <- or = to assign values to variables.

```{r}


# 1. Assign a value to a variable
x <- 5

# 2. Print the value of x
x

# We can also use -> to assign values to variables. But we do not recommend it.

4 -> y


```


--

- We can also use = but it it has special role in functions. So, it is better to use <- for assignment.







---
# Basics -help

-- Use ? to get help about a function.

```{r}
# 1. Get help about a linear model function
?lm

# 2. typing "help(lm)" also gives the same result.
help(lm)

```


---
# Basics -vignettes

-- Use vignette() to get help about a package.

```{r}

# 1. Get help about a ggplo2 package
vignette("ggplot2")

```



---
# Objects

--

- R is an object-oriented language.


--

- Vectors, matrices, data frames (like data.table), lists, functions, etc. are objects.


--

- Each objects has rules and properties. For example, a vector can only contain one type of data. A matrix can contain multiple types of data.



```{r}

# Create a data frame called "d"
d <- data.frame(x = 1:2, y = 3:4)
d
# Convert it to (i.e. create) a matrix call "m"
m <- as.matrix(d)
m


```



---
# Object class, type and structure.



```{r}
d <- data.frame(x = 1:2, y = 3:4)
class(d) # class of d

typeof(d) # type of d

str(d) # structure of d


```



---
# Global environment


```{r}

# Create a data frame called "d"
d <- data.frame(x = 1:2, y = 3:4)

# Let's try regress y on x

lm(y ~ x) # Error in eval(predvars, data, env): object 'y' not found


lm(y ~ x, data = d)

```



---
# Reserved words

- if
- else
- repeat
- while
- function
- for
- in
- next
- break
- TRUE
- FALSE
- NULL
- Inf
- NaN
- NA


---
# Indexing

--
- We can use "[" to index a vector, matrix, or data frame.

```{r}

a <- c(1:10)
a[4] # forth element of a

my_list = list(a = "hello", b = c(1,2,3), c = data.frame(x = 1:5, y = 6:10))
my_list[[1]]

my_list[[2]][3]

```


---
# Indexing

--
- We can also use "$" to index a list or data frame.

```{r}
my_list = list(a = "hello", b = c(1,2,3), c = data.frame(x = 1:5, y = 6:10))
my_list$a

my_list$b

my_list$c
my_list$b[3]

```



---
# Indexing

--
- We can also use "$" to index a list or data frame.

```{r}
my_list = list(a = "hello", b = c(1,2,3), c = data.frame(x = 1:5, y = 6:10))
my_list$b[3]
my_list$c$x
```




---
# Indexing

--
- We can also use "$" to index a list or data frame.

```{r}
d <- data.frame(x = 1:2, y = 3:4)
lm(d$y ~ d$x)
```



---
# Functions

--
- Functions are the building blocks of R. Examples of functions are mean(), sd(), lm(), etc.

```{r}
example_function = function (a, b) {
output = a + b
return (output)
}
example_function(1,2)
```


---
# Libraries

--
- Functions are the building blocks of R. Examples of functions are mean(), sd(), lm(), etc.

```{r}
library(data.table)
```
