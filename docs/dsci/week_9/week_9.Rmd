# Causal inference

--

- Causal inference is the process of drawing conclusions about causal relationships from data, often using statistical methods to control for confounding variables.

--

- It is important to distinguish between correlation and causation, as correlation does not imply causation.

--

- Causal inference methods include randomized controlled trials, observational studies, and quasi-experimental designs.


--

- Difference-in-differences (DiD) is a quasi-experimental design that compares the changes in outcomes over time between a treatment group and a control group, allowing for the estimation of causal effects.


--

- RDD (Regression Discontinuity Design) is another quasi-experimental design that exploits a cutoff or threshold to identify causal effects, often used when random assignment is not feasible.



---
# Causal inference


--

- Instrumental variables (IV) are used to address endogeneity issues in regression analysis, where an instrument is correlated with the treatment but not directly with the outcome, allowing for causal inference.


--

- PSM (Propensity Score Matching) is a method used to control for confounding variables by matching treated and control units based on their propensity scores, which estimate the probability of treatment assignment given observed covariates.


--

- As we saw in the last week, `fixest` package can be used to implement causal inference methods in R, including DiD, RDD, IV, and PSM, providing a flexible framework for regression analysis with fixed effects.

# DiD


--

- DiD is a method used to estimate the causal effect of a treatment on an outcome by comparing the changes in outcomes over time between a treatment group and a control group.

--

- For example, if a new policy is implemented in one state but not in another, the changes in outcomes in the two states can be compared to estimate the effect of the policy.

--

- In this lecture, we will focus on the difference-in-differences (DiD) method, which is a popular approach in causal inference.

# Event study

--

- An event study is a statistical method used to assess the impact of a specific event on the value of a firm or an economy.

--

- It serves two thing: parallel trend test that the treatment and control groups have similar trends before the event, and the dynamic effect of the event on the outcome variable.



---
# Timing of the treatment

--

- Examples above assume that the treatment is applied at the same time for all units, which is defined as non-staggered DiD.


--

- If the timing of the treatment is not common across units, staggered DiD can be used to estimate the treatment effect by allowing for different treatment timings across units.


--

- Modern methods for staggered DiD include the use of synthetic control methods, which create a synthetic control group that mimics the characteristics of the treatment group before the treatment.




---
# Exposure to the treatment

--

- In some cases, the treatment may not be applied uniformly across all units, leading to varying levels of exposure to the treatment.

--

- In this case treatment is not binary, but continuous, and the treatment effect can be estimated using a continuous treatment variable.
