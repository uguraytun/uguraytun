# What this course is about

--

- This course mainly aims to provide you complementary skills to standard  econometrics course.


--

- This involves the data cleaning, wrangling, data visualization, and data analysis (regression, machine learning etc).

# What is data?

--

- Data is a collection of facts, such as numbers, words, measurements, observations or just descriptions of things.

--

- Data can be qualitative (text, maps, photographs, social media (X, Instagram, Spotify)..) or quantitative (economic variables (prices, wages, trade, output, consumption etc.)).

--

- Qualitative data can be analyzed in multiple ways. One common method is data coding, which refers to the process of transforming the raw collected data into a set of meaningful categories that describe essential concepts of the data.

--

- Quantitative data can be measured in different ways: e-commerce data (IKEA, hepsiburada..). This challenges the traditional metrics such as CPI, GDP because they are not able to capture the economic activities adequately.
