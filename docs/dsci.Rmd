**Description**

Data is a crucial resource for understanding and interpreting the world around us. Effectively harnessing this resource is essential for deriving meaningful insights. In economics, the importance of data has grown significantly with the proliferation of diverse sources, including administrative datasets, large-scale surveys, and social media data.

This course aims to introduce students to the modern data science toolkit. It covers the fundamentals of data manipulation, visualization, and key statistical techniques, such as regression analysis. The primary tool for this course is R, an open-source programming language widely used by economists. R is a powerful tool for data analysis and visualization, and it is an essential skill for any economist working with data. It also helps us to estimate big data with high-dimensional fixed effects.

**Course objectives**

Students will learn how to use R for economic analysis and the basic tools of data science. By using R and RStudio, students will be able to import, clean, manipulate, visualize, report, present, and analyze data. They will also learn how to write reports and create presentations using R Markdown.

**Learning outcomes**

Basic programming skills in R programming language

Accessing and importing data from various sources

Manipulating, converting and storing data using data.table, collapse, haven and fst packages

Data visualization using ggplot2

Statistical analysis using regression models with fixest package

Difference-in-differences and event study analysis

Poisson estimation with high-dimensional fixed effects

Perform reproducible research

Creating reports and presentations using R Markdown

#
#
**Grading**

The course consists of lectures, midterms, homeworks and projects.

Course grades will be based on 2 midterms (30 pts each), 1 project (40 pts), and forum participation (as a bonus, up to 10 pts). There will be no make-up.

 

The project teams will consist of 3 students. Projects will be presented on-line and be submitted by midnight, the same day.

**Getting started with R and RStudio**

In second week, please install R and RStudio on your computer. You can download R from [here](https://cran.r-project.org/) and RStudio from [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

I strongly recommend to use [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) for R programming. But you should sign up to Github in advance. 

Tools > Global Options > Code > Git > Enable GitHub Copilot.
